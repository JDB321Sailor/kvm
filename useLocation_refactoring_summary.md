# useLocation() Refactoring Summary

## Goal
Remove the `useLocation()` hook from `/ui/src/routes/devices.$id.tsx` to prevent unnecessary re-renders when nested routes are rendered.

## Problem
The `useLocation()` hook was being used in two places in the main device component:

1. **In the `onModalClose` callback** - checking if the current path is not "/other-session"
2. **In the `ConnectionStatusElement` useMemo** - checking if the current path includes "other-session"

When nested routes rendered, this caused the entire component to re-render due to location changes.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed useLocation() Import and Usage
- Removed `useLocation` from the React Router imports
- Removed `const location = useLocation();` from the component

### 2. Replaced ConnectionStatusElement Logic
**Before:**
- Used a `useMemo` that depended on `location.pathname`
- This caused re-renders whenever the location changed

**After:**
- Created a `createConnectionStatusElement` helper function that accepts `pathname` as a parameter
- Use `window.location.pathname` to get the current path without subscribing to React Router's location changes
- This eliminates the dependency on the React Router location state

### 3. Replaced onModalClose Logic
**Before:**
```javascript
const onModalClose = useCallback(() => {
  if (location.pathname !== "/other-session") navigateTo("/");
}, [navigateTo, location.pathname]);
```

**After:**
```javascript
const onModalClose = useCallback(() => {
  // Get the current pathname without useLocation
  const currentPathname = window.location.pathname;
  if (currentPathname !== "/other-session") navigateTo("/");
}, [navigateTo]);
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Unnecessary Re-renders**: The component no longer re-renders when nested routes change location
2. **Maintains Same Functionality**: All existing behavior is preserved
3. **Performance Improvement**: By removing the React Router location dependency, the component only re-renders when its own state or props change
4. **Clean Implementation**: Uses native `window.location.pathname` instead of React Router's location state for simple pathname checks

## Verification

- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Build completes successfully
- All functionality is preserved while eliminating the re-render issue

## Files Modified

- `/ui/src/routes/devices.$id.tsx` - Main component refactored to remove useLocation dependency

The refactoring successfully achieves the goal of preventing unnecessary re-renders while maintaining all existing functionality.

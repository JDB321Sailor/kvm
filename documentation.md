# ✅ JETKVM Cloud Docker Deployment

## Summary

A Docker-based nginx deployment with self-signed SSL certificate generation and management scripts for local JETKVM Cloud-API deployment.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 🛡️ **Implemented Self-Signed SSL**
- Generated self-signed certificate for IP address `192.168.1.3`
- Certificate includes Subject Alternative Names for IP and localhost
- Valid for 365 days from generation

### 🌐 **nginx Reverse Proxy**
- Clean, efficient nginx configuration
- HTTP to HTTPS redirects
- API routing (`/api/*` → API container)
- Frontend routing (`/*` → Frontend container)
- Security headers and gzip compression

### 📁 **Streamlined Architecture**
```
Client → nginx (SSL termination) → {
  /api/* → API Container (port 3000)
  /*     → Frontend Container (port 80)
}
```

## 🎯 **Current Endpoints**

- **Main Interface**: `https://192.168.1.3`
- **API Access**: `https://192.168.1.3/api`
- **HTTP Redirect**: `http://192.168.1.3` → `https://192.168.1.3`

## ⚙️ **JetKVM Device Configuration**

Configure your JetKVM devices with these URLs:
- **Cloud API Base URL**: `https://192.168.1.3/api`
- **Cloud Frontend URL**: `https://192.168.1.3`

## 🚀 **Management Commands**

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Generate certificates first!
./regenerate-cert.sh

# Start the stack
./manage-stack.sh up

# Check status
./manage-stack.sh status

# Test endpoints
./manage-stack.sh test

# View certificate info
./manage-stack.sh cert

# Regenerate certificate
./regenerate-cert.sh
```

## ✅ **System Status** (As of July 21, 2025)

| Component | Status | Health |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| PostgreSQL | Running | Healthy |
| API | Running | Healthy |
| Frontend | Running | Healthy |
| nginx | Running | Working* |

*nginx shows "unhealthy" in Docker but is functioning correctly

## 🔒 **Certificate Details**

- **Subject**: CN=192.168.1.3
- **Valid**: July 21, 2025 - July 21, 2026
- **Type**: Self-signed RSA 2048-bit
- **SAN**: IP:192.168.1.3, DNS:localhost

## ⚠️ **Browser Certificate Warning**

Users will see a certificate warning because it's self-signed. This is expected and secure for internal use:
1. Click "Advanced" in browser
2. Click "Proceed to 192.168.1.3"
3. Certificate will be remembered for future visits

## 📊 **Test Results**

- ✅ HTTPS main interface (200 OK)
- ✅ HTTPS API endpoints (200 OK)
- ✅ HTTP to HTTPS redirect (301)
- ✅ SSL certificate valid
- ✅ Security headers applied
- ✅ Gzip compression enabled

## 🎉 **Benefits Achieved**

1. **Self-Signed SSL Implementation**: Secure nginx configuration with locally generated certificates
2. **No External Dependencies**: No Cloudflare API tokens or DNS challenges required
3. **IP-Based Access**: No domain name requirements - works with local network IPs
4. **Self-Contained**: All certificates generated locally using regenerate-cert.sh
5. **Easy Management**: Command line scripts for all operations
6. **Fast Deployment**: Quick certificate generation and stack startup
7. **Reliable**: No external service dependencies or internet requirements

The system is now production-ready with a self-signed certificate architecture that's easy to understand, maintain, and troubleshoot!
